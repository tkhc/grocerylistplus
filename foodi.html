					<h2>Seasonal Food Guide</h2>
					
					<a class="roll" href="https://www.seasonalfoodguide.org/" target="_blank">Find
						What's in Season Near
						You</a>
					<p>Seasonal fruits and vegetables produced on local farms are often fresher, as they do not
						require long distances for transport. Also, unlike out of season produce which is harvested
						early
						in order to be shipped and distributed to your local retail store, crops picked at their peak of
						ripeness are also better tasting and full of flavor.</p>

					<a class="roll" href="https://foodprint.org/eating-sustainably/real-food-encyclopedia/" target="_blank">Real
						Food Encyclopedia</a>
					<p>Get real about your food with over 200 entries, our comprehensive encyclopedia helps you understand the foodprint of each food listed. You’ll learn how sustainable (or unsustainable!) each food is, what to look for
					when shopping for it and even tips on how to cook it.</p>

					<h2>Buy Local, Eat Local</h2>
					<a class="roll" href="https://www.ams.usda.gov/local-food-directories/farmersmarkets" target="_blank">Find Your
						Local Farmer's Market</a>
					<p>Most produce can be found at your local farmers’ market,
						through local Community Supported Agriculture (CSA) programs operating in your area and at
						restaurants and businesses committed to seasonal, local food.</p>
						<p>Maintained by the Agricultural Marketing Service, the Directory is designed to provide customers with convenient access to information about farmers market listings to include: market locations, directions, operating times, product offerings, accepted forms of payment, and more.</p>

					<h2>Reduce Food Waste</h2>
					<a class="roll" href="https://www.usda.gov/foodwaste/faqs" target="_blank">Learn more about food waste.</a>
					<p>In the United States, food waste is estimated at between 30-40 percent of the food supply. This estimate, based on estimates from USDA’s Economic Research Service of 31 percent food loss at the retail and consumer levels, corresponded to approximately 133 billion pounds and $161 billion worth of food in 2010. This amount of waste has far-reaching impacts on society and our planet.</p>
					<a class="roll" href="https://www.epa.gov/recycle/reducing-wasted-food-home" target="_blank">Reducing wasted food at home.</a>
					<p>There are many ways to reduce food waste. You can start by planning. If planning fails, work on storage and be thrify - cook and bake like a pro, using any ingredients in your fridge. Lastly, if you cannot reduce food waste, divert it from landfills by practicing composting and/or donating to food banks.</p>
